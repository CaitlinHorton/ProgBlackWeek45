                        <p4>A massive benefit of a digital home is the convenience that it offers. Homeowners are able
                            to automate various aspects of their home using smart technologies, to make their everyday
                            lives easier and more efficient. For example, devices such as smart thermostats, lighting
                            systems and various appliances can be controlled remotely by smartphones or, in some cases,
                            voice commands. This allows homeowners to switch off lights when they are out, or even
                            switch them on when they are coming home. You will also be able to adjust the temperature
                            and start your coffee maker without having to move from where you are. Homeowners could also
                            make us of scheduling features to have the lights automatically dim in the evening or have
                            the coffee machine start making coffee in the morning before waking up.
