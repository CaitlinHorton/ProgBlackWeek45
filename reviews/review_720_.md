# Interest of content
- Information is detailed, and high-quality
- Good research done
- Could have made it more succinct, quicker to read

# Consistency and quality of visual presentation
- Visual presentation is consistent.
- Could be more interesting, but all the information is there.

# Quality of written presentation
- Text is written well
- A little too verbose, could have been shortened

# Validity of HTML
- index.html is quite empty. Could have added more for the home page.
- On other pages, html is structured well and is easy to read.

# evidence of collaboration
- There is evidence that multiple people collaborated on the project
- Commits were often pushed to main, which makes it harder to see who worked on what.
